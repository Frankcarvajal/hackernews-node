### Built a GraphQL server from scratch.

The stack used was based on **Node.js, graphql-yoga and Prisma.**

`graphql-yoga` is a fast and simple GraphQL server library `built on top of Express.js`. It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for `GraphQL Playgrounds and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.`

The resolvers of my GraphQL server are implemented using the `Prisma client that’s responsible for database access.`
